# Statistics Notebook

This notebook covers foundational and advanced topics in statistics, focusing on concepts critical for data analysis and machine learning.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Gaussian distribution and summary statistics:** population vs sample, central tendency, variance  
- **Simple data visualization:** Matplotlib basics, line plots, bar charts, histograms, box plots, scatter plots  
- **Random numbers:** pseudorandom number generation, seeding, controlling randomness  
- **Law of large numbers and Central Limit Theorem:** theory, examples, and implications in ML  
- **Statistical hypothesis testing:** test interpretation, error types, degrees of freedom  
- **Statistical distributions:** Gaussian, Student’s t, Chi-squared  
- **Critical values and their use in tests**  
- **Covariance and correlation:** Pearson’s correlation, test datasets  
- **Significance tests:** parametric tests (t-test, ANOVA, repeated measures)  
- **Effect size and statistical power:** importance, calculation, power analysis  
- **Resampling methods:** statistical sampling, bootstrap, cross-validation  
- **Estimation statistics:** problems with hypothesis testing, interval estimation, meta-analysis  
- **Tolerance and confidence intervals:** calculation and interpretation  
- **Prediction intervals:** calculation and worked examples  
- **Nonparametric methods:** rank data, ranking, rank correlation (Spearman, Kendall), significance tests (Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, Friedman)  
- **Independence tests:** contingency tables, Pearson’s Chi-squared test  

This notebook provides clear tutorials, practical examples, and worked problems to build a solid understanding of statistics essential for data scientists and ML practitioners.
