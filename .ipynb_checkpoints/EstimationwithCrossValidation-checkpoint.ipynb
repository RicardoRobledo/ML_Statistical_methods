    "There are a number of variations on the k-fold cross-validation procedure. Three commonly used variations are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Train/Test Split**:  \n",
    "  Taken to one extreme, *k* may be set to 1 such that a single train/test split is created to evaluate the model.\n",

    "- **LOOCV (Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation)**:  \n",
    "  Taken to another extreme, *k* may be set to the total number of observations in the dataset such that each observation is given a chance to be the held-out of the dataset. This is called **leave-one-out cross-validation**, or **LOOCV** for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stratified**:  \n",
    "  The splitting of data into folds may be governed by criteria such as ensuring that each fold has the same proportion of observations with a given categorical value, such as the class outcome value. This is called **stratified cross-validation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Repeated**:  \n",
    "  This is where the k-fold cross-validation procedure is repeated *n* times, where importantly, the data sample is shuffled prior to each repetition, which results in a different split of the sample.\n"
